[[https://obsidian.md][Obsidian]] should be ideal for this, but I just can't get into it. I've tried so many times.

- =CTRL-n= and =CTRL-p= (Emacs) bindings don't work in lists (such as the switcher and command palettes) like they do in nearly every other app on my Mac
- I don't like how it looks
- I don't like how it /feels/ (it's no real Mac app, that's for sure)
- The Daily Notes feature is not as smooth or useful

This is disappointing for me, because Obsidian otherwise ticks all the right boxes. Unfortunately, if I'm not feeling it, I won't be using it.

From the paper [[https://www.academia.edu/49313911/Bitcoin_Currencies_and_Bubbles][Bitcoin, Currencies, and Bubbles]]:

#+begin_quote
In its current version, in spite of the hype, bitcoin failed to satisfy the notion of "currency without government" (it proved to not even be a currency at all), can be neither a short nor long term store of value (its expected value is no higher than 0), cannot operate as a reliableinflation hedge, and, worst of all, does not constitute, not even remotely, a safe haven for one’s investments, a shield against government tyranny, nor a tail protection vehicle for catastrophic episodes.
#+end_quote

And later:

#+begin_quote
The customary standard argument is "bitcoin has its ﬂaws but we are getting a great technology, we will do wonders with the blockchain". No, there is noevidence that we are getting a great technology — unless"great technology" doesn’t mean "useful". And we have done at the time of writing—in spite of all the fanfare—still close to nothing with the blockchain. So we close with a Damascus joke. One vendor was sellingthe exact same variety of cucumbers at two different prices."Why is this one twice the price?", the merchant was asked." They came on higher quality mules" was the answer. We only judge a technology by how it solves problems, not in what technological attributes it has.

It's great that there's a generous free tier, but it comes with a couple limitations.

- The free tier does not support redirects
- The free tier does not automatically redirect http->https
- Deployment is not based on diffs. The entire app is re-uploaded each time.

I tried it with baty.net and was able to create my account and deploy the site to a .surge.sh subdomain in just a few lines in the terminal. That was neat. I may try it for smaller or infrequently-deployed static sites.

The iPad may be the greatest computer peripheral ever made. As a main device for me, though, it's once again been a spectacular failure.

I recently made yet [[https://copingmechanism.com/2021/trying-to-live-on-the-ipad-for-a-while/][another attempt at living on the iPad]] as my main device. It lasted less than a week. Going all-in on the iPad feels so nice and simple and liberating...for a day or two. After that, the constant reminders of its limitations quickly go from minor nuisance to deal-breaking irritation.

I've tucked my tail between my legs and scurried back into the arms of my Mac.

For my purposes, a computer needs fast, deep access to clipboard history, universal complex text expansion, reasonable window management, and a much larger screen. iOS can be coerced to do some of these, but doesn't do any of them as well.

And the elephant in the room? Emacs and Org mode. I cannot seem to detach myself from Org mode. I've tried. In fact this latest move to using an iPad was really just another thinly-veiled attempt to leave Org mode behind. And once again the effort failed because Org mode is just too good at too many things.

So the iPad is once again relegated to it's rightful place as a peripheral device. I love using it for browsing, watching stuff, writing journal entries in Day One, minor photo editing, and drawing. For everything else, I prefer the Mac.

   :END:

   One of the few valid arguments against paper notebooks is that they are more difficult to search than digital notes. Fine, I'll concede that one. But I'm working on a patch for that.

#+hugo: more

Rather than trying to digitize/OCR /everything/, I've decided that a simple index of topics should be sufficient. While rummaging around for ways to do this, I found [[https://github.com/sobjornstad/mindex][Soren Bjornstad's mindex]]. Mindex is a small Python script that takes some input and generates a concise LaTeX-then-PDF index based on a simple text (.mindex) file.

Here's a section of the .mindex file for my current notebook:

#+begin_example
Books       32
Charlie     37-41
COVID-19    23,32,39
Creativity  43
Crypto      35
Devices     34
Fusionary   21, 26
Health      26,41
Investing   26
Journaling  21,37
#+end_example

It's a tab-delimited file with Topic->Pages->Sort Key. The third column, Sort Key, allows for tweaking of where each entry ends up in the final index. I've not needed to use that yet, though.

I wanted a few minor formatting changes so I forked Soren's repo to https://github.com/jackbaty/mindex and tweaked it a little. Here's the current output:

#+caption: Index sample
[[file:/img/2021/notebook-index.png]]

I think it looks nice. LaTeX is awesome. I'm planning to update the index once a month or so. I just did it for May and it only took about 10 minutes. That's not too high a price to pay for the ability to find things more quickly. Once a notebook is complete I may print a copy and insert it right into that notebook.


I'm still thinking about how to best manage this, but it's a nice start.

** DONE Pilot Custom 823 Fountain Pen

It's been a while since I bought a new fountain pen. This is about the *Pilot Custom 823*.

#+hugo: more

   [[file:/img/2021/823.jpg]]

Literally every review I've read says the same things: "It's not a looker, but what a great writer!" I can only resist that kind of consensus for so long, so I bought one. I have the "smoke" color with a fine nib. I [[https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Custom-823-Fountain-Pen-Black-Body-Fine-Nib/pd/21024][ordered it from JetPens]] for $270. I'd say this puts it well into significant purchase territory, so I was very excited when it arrived. I've been journaling quite a lot recently and was looking forward to spending time with what reviewers call one of the best every day writers.

I'd like to tell you that it was love at first write, but that hasn't been the case. The pen looks fine, if a little boring. I didn't get it for its looks, so I don't mind. The pen feels very good in hand, too. This is important. It's not too heavy or unbalanced, either with the cap posted or not.

It's a vacuum filler, which is apparently unusual but I'm not sure why, as it's
super easy to fill. It holds a lot of ink, too. It does make it more difficult
to switch inks, but I don't switch often so I don't mind.

So what's not to love, then? Well, so far I don't love how it /writes/. I bought the pen to write with and not look at, so this is a problem. It's been inconsistently scratchy and has skipped more often than is normal. At first I thought of it simply as "feedback" but it's worse than just feedback. It feels /dry/. I'm left-handed, so any scratchiness in a pen is amplified. It's disappointing. Since the ink chamber is sealed from the feed, it's recommended to keep the plunger unscrewed (at the finial) while writing. I'm doing that, but it doesn't make a significant difference.

It's possible I got a bum copy, but I'm loathe to ship things back and wait so I have a few things I'd like to try first.

First, I will run it with some different inks. I typically use one of the quick-drying Nooder inks like [[https://noodlersink.com/product/19067-bernanke-blue/][Bernanke Blue]], but maybe something "wetter" will fare better.

I could try different paper, but that's not helpful since I have no interest in anything other than the Leuchtturm notebooks for most writing. I did write a little in the Hobonichi Techo and things were better. Tamoe River paper is the greatest, but I don't like most of the notebooks that use it (other than the Techo, that is, but I don't journal in the Techo.)

If these don't help, I'll advance to something more drastic, such as physically spreading the nib by pulling it apart at the shoulder, just a little. If that doesn't help with the flow, I'll send it to a "nibmeister" for tweaking. I normally would scoff at doing that, but years ago I sent my Pelikan to Richard Binder and it came back flawless. Still is.

I don't want to doubt the nearly unanimous consensus about the Pilot Custom 823, so I am still going with the theory that mine needs some work. Still, I sure hope I can fix the issue and that the pen lives up to its stellar reputation.

:PROPERTIES:

:EXPORT_DATE: <2021-05-31 Mon>
:END:

I was never a great programmer, but I was a pretty good /developer/. By this I mean that I could solve real problems for people by writing software.

#+hugo: more

I don't enjoy coming up with clever algorithms and I hate math. But most development is just storage and retrieval of data, and I like storing, retrieving, and displaying data.

But I no longer enjoy writing code. I'm not sure why. I think maybe it's because in recent years at Fusionary, my role moved away from programming. This meant I no longer kept up with details of the latest techniques and trends. I knew what was being done and (most of the time) why, but the ability to actually do any of it got away from me.

Now that I've lagged so far behind "state of the art," it feels impossible to catch up. I've made furtive attempts, but end up a frustrated old man yelling at clouds. I don't think this is all my fault. I believe things have become way over-complicated and overwrought, caused by too many devs reading blog posts about how Facebook or Pinterest does things and then assuming that's the way everyone should do things. Too clever by half.

But, I admit that the way I did things isn't nearly good enough today. Maybe that's why I give up so quickly. It's not fun like it was in the Good Old Days™. At least it's not fun for me.

Front-end web dev is, to me, mired in frameworks and "best practices" that maybe shouldn't be.
Maybe it's not that I don't like writing code, maybe it's the bog-standard JavaScript-riddled front end development I don't like. Perhaps I should look into Ops, or ML or AI or AR. Maybe learn Go or Clojure or, if I'm feeling feisty, Rust.

Or maybe instead I should just get that paper route I always wanted.
** DONE Local theme development when using Hugo Modules :hugo:@Tech:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: local-theme-development-when-using-hugo-modules
:EXPORT_DATE: <2021-05-27 Thu>
:END:

Recent versions of [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]] prefer the use of [[https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules][Go Modules]] for managing themes. This is new and a little weird to me, but I'm slowly beginning to understand it. I'm documenting the process here so I don't forget.

#+hugo: more

I've forked an original theme ([[https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even][Even]]) for use here. To tell Hugo where the theme is, I added the following to my site's config.toml...

#+begin_src toml
[module]
[[module.imports]]
    path = "github.com/jackbaty/hugo-theme-even"
    disabled = false
#+end_src

With this in place, running =hugo mod get= will do its magic and use the code in the referenced Github repo as the site's theme. By default, modules seem to mount in "themes/", so this just works. It feels a little magic because nothing actually lives in "themes/". This took some getting used to.

But with the site using code from a (remote) repo, how do I work on the theme locally? I don't want to have to make a change in a local repo, then commit-push-get to test every little change. After some digging, I learned that Hugo has a [[https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/configuration/#module-config-top-level]["replacements" feature in modules]].

Replacements allow Hugo to temporarily use other mounts/modules. I only want to use my local copy of the theme while doing development, so I added the replacement as an environment variable in .zshrc like so:

#+begin_src sh
export HUGO_MODULE_REPLACEMENTS="github.com/jackbaty/hugo-theme-even -> /Users/jbaty/dev/hugo-theme-even"
#+end_src

Now, when running hugo serve locally, it picks up my local repo automatically, but server builds will use the "real" repo from Github. Clever.

And so far, all of this "Just Works" when deploying to Netlify.

UPDATE: I've learned that in order for Hugo/Netlify to pick up changes to the remote theme repo, there must be a "release" created in Github. Also, I've changed the build command from just `hugo` to `hugo mod get && hugo` otherwise it doesn't always seem to pick up the new theme release.

I've used ox-hugo before, but I end up either drifting away from Org mode and/or Hugo and forget what a powerful combination ox-hugo, Org mode, and Hugo can be.

The great thing is that I have all my posts in a single Org file, each as its own heading. Each heading is rendered as individual Markdown files with Hugo-compatible frontmatter.

A few highlights:

- I use an org timestamp for the entry date and add posts.org to my agenda files so I see what I posted on a given day in my org agenda.
- I have a yasnippet that helps me fill in the post metadata
- Posts are rendered automatically when saving via local variable: =# eval: (org-hugo-auto-export-mode)=
