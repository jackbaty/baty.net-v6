I'm sorry, Safari, but until you reconsider the completely and objectively[^fn:1] terrible changes made in version 15, I'll be using [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com). I never thought I'd end up back in a Chromium based browser, but Vivaldi is quite nice. It packs a lot of capabilities into a small space. This, as opposed to Safari 15, which removed a small set of capabilities in the unnecessary quest to take up less space.

[Gabe, Macdrifter](http://www.macdrifter.com/2021/06/forced-social-engagement.html):

> Am I the only one that's noticed a rise in app developers pushing customers into mandated relationships through Discord and Slack as "support" channels? It feels like a trend and I am not onboard with this investment in other people's business. Sure, I love a good user forum, but Slack and Discord are garbage user forums.

Strong agree.

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Safari 15 on Mac OS, a user interface mess" data-author="@morrick" cite="https://morrick.me/archives/9368">
The utter user-interface butchery happening to Safari on the Mac is once again the work of people who put iOS first. People who by now think in iOS terms. People who view the venerable Mac OS user interface as an older person whose traits must be experimented upon, plastic surgery after plastic surgery, until this person looks younger.

It's almost as if the Mac team within Apple has been replaced by a bunch of kids who grew up on iOS.


## <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> "Just Link" - no don't {#just-link-no-don-t}

In his post "[Just Link](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/just-link/)", Robin Sloan (whom I love), suggests that, instead of sending newsletter content in an email, publishers send an email with only a link to the actual content.

> But, weighing all these considerations, if it’s possible for you, as a

That's not an email newsletter, that's spam. What you're doing is blogging and emailing me a link to new posts. If all I wanted was to be notified that you posted something on your blog, there's RSS.

Unsubscribed[^fn:2]


## <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> I'm basically blogging with TiddlyWiki at this point {#i-m-basically-blogging-with-tiddlywiki-at-this-point}

I'm not sure why I still have this blog. I write nearly everything over at the [Rudimentary Lathe wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.wiki). Photography posts go on [Copingmechanism.com](https://copingmechanism.com).

It's just that TiddlyWiki doesn't make a great blogging platform. Plus, mine has too much noise to be useful to anyone other than myself. But boy howdy is it ever useful to me. I think I should continue focusing on its usefulness to me, and if others are sufficiently motivated they can figure out how to follow along. I'm still thinking about how to make that easier, though.


## <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> I just can't get into Obsidian {#i-just-can-t-get-into-obsidian}

I want to put all my long-term thinking into a nice, future-proof, private-first folder full of text files, I really do.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) should be ideal for this, but I just can't get into it. I've tried so many times.

-   `CTRL-n` and `CTRL-p` (Emacs) bindings don't work in lists (such as the switcher and command palettes) like they do in nearly every other app on my Mac
-   I don't like how it looks
-   I don't like how it _feels_ (it's no real Mac app, that's for sure)
-   The Daily Notes feature is not as smooth or useful

This is disappointing for me, because Obsidian otherwise ticks all the right boxes. Unfortunately, if I'm not feeling it, I won't be using it.


## <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> Bitcoin, Currencies, and Bubbles - Nassim Nicholas Taleb {#bitcoin-currencies-and-bubbles-nassim-nicholas-taleb}

From the paper [Bitcoin, Currencies, and Bubbles](https://www.academia.edu/49313911/Bitcoin%5FCurrencies%5Fand%5FBubbles):

> In its current version, in spite of the hype, bitcoin failed to satisfy the notion of "currency without government" (it proved to not even be a currency at all), can be neither a short nor long term store of value (its expected value is no higher than 0), cannot operate as a reliableinflation hedge, and, worst of all, does not constitute, not even remotely, a safe haven for one’s investments, a shield against government tyranny, nor a tail protection vehicle for catastrophic episodes.

And later:

> The customary standard argument is "bitcoin has its ﬂaws but we are getting a great technology, we will do wonders with the blockchain". No, there is noevidence that we are getting a great technology — unless"great technology" doesn’t mean "useful". And we have done at the time of writing—in spite of all the fanfare—still close to nothing with the blockchain. So we close with a Damascus joke. One vendor was sellingthe exact same variety of cucumbers at two different prices."Why is this one twice the price?", the merchant was asked." They came on higher quality mules" was the answer. We only judge a technology by how it solves problems, not in what technological attributes it has.


## <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> Domain change - We're now at baty.blog {#domain-change-we-re-now-at-baty-dot-blog}

I've concluded that the v6.baty.net domain was a dumb idea and I'm retiring it. To kill two birds with one stone, I'm also retiring my blot.im blog and commandeering that domain for use here. So we're now at baty.blog.

I'm sorry if this breaks things. I'll move the original Blot content here as time allows.


## <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> surge.sh {#surge-dot-sh}

I tried [Surge.sh](https://surge.sh) and it's pretty slick.

> Static web publishing for Front-End Developers
>
> Simple, single-command web publishing. Publish HTML, CSS, and JS for free, without leaving the command line.

It's great that there's a generous free tier, but it comes with a couple limitations.

-   The free tier does not support redirects
-   The free tier does not automatically redirect http->https
-   Deployment is not based on diffs. The entire app is re-uploaded each time.

I tried it with baty.net and was able to create my account and deploy the site to a .surge.sh subdomain in just a few lines in the terminal. That was neat. I may try it for smaller or infrequently-deployed static sites.


## <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> The iPad is a wonderful peripheral {#the-ipad-is-a-wonderful-peripheral}

The iPad may be the greatest computer peripheral ever made. As a main device for me, though, it's once again been a spectacular failure.

I recently made yet [another attempt at living on the iPad](https://copingmechanism.com/2021/trying-to-live-on-the-ipad-for-a-while/) as my main device. It lasted less than a week. Going all-in on the iPad feels so nice and simple and liberating...for a day or two. After that, the constant reminders of its limitations quickly go from minor nuisance to deal-breaking irritation.

I've tucked my tail between my legs and scurried back into the arms of my Mac.

For my purposes, a computer needs fast, deep access to clipboard history, universal complex text expansion, reasonable window management, and a much larger screen. iOS can be coerced to do some of these, but doesn't do any of them as well.

And the elephant in the room? Emacs and Org mode. I cannot seem to detach myself from Org mode. I've tried. In fact this latest move to using an iPad was really just another thinly-veiled attempt to leave Org mode behind. And once again the effort failed because Org mode is just too good at too many things.

So the iPad is once again relegated to it's rightful place as a peripheral device. I love using it for browsing, watching stuff, writing journal entries in Day One, minor photo editing, and drawing. For everything else, I prefer the Mac.


## <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> An excuse to use Emacs - this blog {#an-excuse-to-use-emacs-this-blog}

If I'm being honest, I created this v6.baty.net blog as an excuse to mess with Hugo and generating its Markdown files using Org mode.

I love me a static website, but I grow lazy and sometimes posting this way is just too much work, ya know? I'll keep it around, but it's likely that most of my posts will be made over at [Coping Mechanism](https://copingmechanism.com).

While I suppose it's possible that Apple saw what HEY was doing and thought, "Now there's a good idea, we should do that!". Possible, but I think maybe DHH is overestimating Basecamp's influence.


## <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> New theme - CodeIT {#new-theme-codeit}

The theme I was using here had an annoying behavior, so I got a new one.

<!--more-->

My original theme, based on Even, did this thing where the content would jump just a little whenever the page loaded. It was driving me nuts, and I couldn't figure out what was causing it, so I punted and forked [CodeIT](https://github.com/sunt-programator/CodeIT).

You may recognize CodeIT because it was what I used before [archiving baty.net](https://archive.baty.net) a few months ago.


## <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> Creating a digital index for my paper notebooks {#creating-a-digital-index-for-my-paper-notebooks}

One of the few valid arguments against paper notebooks is that they are more difficult to search than digital notes. Fine, I'll concede that one. But I'm working on a patch for that.

<!--more-->

Rather than trying to digitize/OCR _everything_, I've decided that a simple index of topics should be sufficient. While rummaging around for ways to do this, I found [Soren Bjornstad's mindex](https://github.com/sobjornstad/mindex). Mindex is a small Python script that takes some input and generates a concise LaTeX-then-PDF index based on a simple text (.mindex) file.

Here's a section of the .mindex file for my current notebook:

```text
Books       32
Charlie     37-41
COVID-19    23,32,39
Creativity  43
Crypto      35
Devices     34
Fusionary   21, 26
Health      26,41
Investing   26
Journaling  21,37
```

It's a tab-delimited file with Topic->Pages->Sort Key. The third column, Sort Key, allows for tweaking of where each entry ends up in the final index. I've not needed to use that yet, though.

I wanted a few minor formatting changes so I forked Soren's repo to <https://github.com/jackbaty/mindex> and tweaked it a little. Here's the current output:

{{< figure src="/img/2021/notebook-index.png" caption="Figure 1: Index sample" >}}

I think it looks nice. LaTeX is awesome. I'm planning to update the index once a month or so. I just did it for May and it only took about 10 minutes. That's not too high a price to pay for the ability to find things more quickly. Once a notebook is complete I may print a copy and insert it right into that notebook.

I'm still thinking about how to best manage this, but it's a nice start.


## <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> Pilot Custom 823 Fountain Pen {#pilot-custom-823-fountain-pen}

It's been a while since I bought a new fountain pen. This is about the **Pilot Custom 823**.

<!--more-->

{{< figure src="/img/2021/823.jpg" >}}

Literally every review I've read says the same things: "It's not a looker, but what a great writer!" I can only resist that kind of consensus for so long, so I bought one. I have the "smoke" color with a fine nib. I [ordered it from JetPens](https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Custom-823-Fountain-Pen-Black-Body-Fine-Nib/pd/21024) for $270. I'd say this puts it well into significant purchase territory, so I was very excited when it arrived. I've been journaling quite a lot recently and was looking forward to spending time with what reviewers call one of the best every day writers.

I'd like to tell you that it was love at first write, but that hasn't been the case. The pen looks fine, if a little boring. I didn't get it for its looks, so I don't mind. The pen feels very good in hand, too. This is important. It's not too heavy or unbalanced, either with the cap posted or not.

It's a vacuum filler, which is apparently unusual but I'm not sure why, as it's
super easy to fill. It holds a lot of ink, too. It does make it more difficult
to switch inks, but I don't switch often so I don't mind.

So what's not to love, then? Well, so far I don't love how it _writes_. I bought the pen to write with and not look at, so this is a problem. It's been inconsistently scratchy and has skipped more often than is normal. At first I thought of it simply as "feedback" but it's worse than just feedback. It feels _dry_. I'm left-handed, so any scratchiness in a pen is amplified. It's disappointing. Since the ink chamber is sealed from the feed, it's recommended to keep the plunger unscrewed (at the finial) while writing. I'm doing that, but it doesn't make a significant difference.

It's possible I got a bum copy, but I'm loathe to ship things back and wait so I have a few things I'd like to try first.

First, I will run it with some different inks. I typically use one of the quick-drying Nooder inks like [Bernanke Blue](https://noodlersink.com/product/19067-bernanke-blue/), but maybe something "wetter" will fare better.

I could try different paper, but that's not helpful since I have no interest in anything other than the Leuchtturm notebooks for most writing. I did write a little in the Hobonichi Techo and things were better. Tamoe River paper is the greatest, but I don't like most of the notebooks that use it (other than the Techo, that is, but I don't journal in the Techo.)

If these don't help, I'll advance to something more drastic, such as physically spreading the nib by pulling it apart at the shoulder, just a little. If that doesn't help with the flow, I'll send it to a "nibmeister" for tweaking. I normally would scoff at doing that, but years ago I sent my Pelikan to Richard Binder and it came back flawless. Still is.

I don't want to doubt the nearly unanimous consensus about the Pilot Custom 823, so I am still going with the theory that mine needs some work. Still, I sure hope I can fix the issue and that the pen lives up to its stellar reputation.

## <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> Added Goatcounter analytics {#added-goatcounter-analytics}

Since [Goatcounter](https://www.goatcounter.com) is free for non-commercial use under 100,000 views per month, I thought I'd give it another try.

<!--more-->

I've been using [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) for a long time and have no issues. Still, Goatcounter is free and at least as privacy-minded and who am I not to at least try it?

UPDATE 2021-06-05: I still find Goatcounter too hard to parse, so I'm removing it.


## <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> Running Doom and Nano emacs at the same time using Chemacs {#running-doom-and-nano-emacs-at-the-same-time-using-chemacs}

Most of the time I use a [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) configuration, but sometimes I feel like testing something new. I've been enamored by [Nano Emacs](https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs) lately, but there's no way I'll switch to it permanently.

Today I learned about [Chemacs](https://github.com/plexus/chemacs2).

<!--more-->

> Chemacs 2 is an Emacs profile switcher, it makes it easy to run multiple Emacs configurations side by side.

So I configured Chemacs and added profiles for my default Doom config and also one for Nano. This is crazy, but I can now run both configurations _at the same time_!. Here's a screenshot. The left window is Org-journal in Nano and the right window is my org-mode configuration in Doom.

## <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> I no longer enjoy writing code {#i-no-longer-enjoy-writing-code}

I was never a great programmer, but I was a pretty good _developer_. By this I mean that I could solve real problems for people by writing software.

<!--more-->

I don't enjoy coming up with clever algorithms and I hate math. But most development is just storage and retrieval of data, and I like storing, retrieving, and displaying data.

But I no longer enjoy writing code. I'm not sure why. I think maybe it's because in recent years at Fusionary, my role moved away from programming. This meant I no longer kept up with details of the latest techniques and trends. I knew what was being done and (most of the time) why, but the ability to actually do any of it got away from me.

Now that I've lagged so far behind "state of the art," it feels impossible to catch up. I've made furtive attempts, but end up a frustrated old man yelling at clouds. I don't think this is all my fault. I believe things have become way over-complicated and overwrought, caused by too many devs reading blog posts about how Facebook or Pinterest does things and then assuming that's the way everyone should do things. Too clever by half.

But, I admit that the way I did things isn't nearly good enough today. Maybe that's why I give up so quickly. It's not fun like it was in the Good Old Days™. At least it's not fun for me.

Front-end web dev is, to me, mired in frameworks and "best practices" that maybe shouldn't be.
Maybe it's not that I don't like writing code, maybe it's the bog-standard JavaScript-riddled front end development I don't like. Perhaps I should look into Ops, or ML or AI or AR. Maybe learn Go or Clojure or, if I'm feeling feisty, Rust.

Or maybe instead I should just get that paper route I always wanted.


## <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> Local theme development when using Hugo Modules {#local-theme-development-when-using-hugo-modules}

Recent versions of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) prefer the use of [Go Modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) for managing themes. This is new and a little weird to me, but I'm slowly beginning to understand it. I'm documenting the process here so I don't forget.

<!--more-->

I've forked an original theme ([Even](https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even)) for use here. To tell Hugo where the theme is, I added the following to my site's config.toml...

```toml
[module]
[[module.imports]]
    path = "github.com/jackbaty/hugo-theme-even"
    disabled = false
```

With this in place, running `hugo mod get` will do its magic and use the code in the referenced Github repo as the site's theme. By default, modules seem to mount in "themes/", so this just works. It feels a little magic because nothing actually lives in "themes/". This took some getting used to.

But with the site using code from a (remote) repo, how do I work on the theme locally? I don't want to have to make a change in a local repo, then commit-push-get to test every little change. After some digging, I learned that Hugo has a ["replacements" feature in modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/configuration/#module-config-top-level).

Replacements allow Hugo to temporarily use other mounts/modules. I only want to use my local copy of the theme while doing development, so I added the replacement as an environment variable in .zshrc like so:

```sh
export HUGO_MODULE_REPLACEMENTS="github.com/jackbaty/hugo-theme-even -> /Users/jbaty/dev/hugo-theme-even"
```

Now, when running hugo serve locally, it picks up my local repo automatically, but server builds will use the "real" repo from Github. Clever.

And so far, all of this "Just Works" when deploying to Netlify.

UPDATE: I've learned that in order for Hugo/Netlify to pick up changes to the remote theme repo, there must be a "release" created in Github. Also, I've changed the build command from just \`hugo\` to \`hugo mod get && hugo\` otherwise it doesn't always seem to pick up the new theme release.


## <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> Grok TiddlyWiki {#grok-tiddlywiki}

[Soren Bjornstad](https://sorenbjornstad.com/) has recently released the first edition of [Grok TiddlyWiki](https://groktiddlywiki.com/read/) and it's terrific.

> Grok TiddlyWiki is a textbook that helps you build a deep, lasting understanding of and proficiency with TiddlyWiki through a combination of detailed explanations, practical exercises, and spaced-repetition reviews of prompts called takeaways.

<!--more-->

A chief complaint about TiddlyWiki is that it’s difficult to learn. This is not unfounded. The documentation is complete, but hard to parse and there are few resources for actually learning TiddlyWiki. Grok TiddlyWiki is a fantastic resource and if you’re even remotely interested in learning more about TiddlyWiki, it’s highly recommended. My goodness, TiddlyWiki is amazing.


## <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> I almost forgot how fun ox-hugo is {#i-almost-forgot-how-fun-ox-hugo-is}

[ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co) is "an Org exporter backend that exports Org to Hugo-compatible Markdown (Blackfriday) and also generates the front-matter (in TOML or YAML format)."

It's more fun than it sounds.

<!--more-->

I've used ox-hugo before, but I end up either drifting away from Org mode and/or Hugo and forget what a powerful combination ox-hugo, Org mode, and Hugo can be.

The great thing is that I have all my posts in a single Org file, each as its own heading. Each heading is rendered as individual Markdown files with Hugo-compatible frontmatter.

A few highlights:

-   I use an org timestamp for the entry date and add posts.org to my agenda files so I see what I posted on a given day in my org agenda.
-   I have a yasnippet that helps me fill in the post metadata
-   Posts are rendered automatically when saving via local variable: `# eval: (org-hugo-auto-export-mode)`

The posts.org frontmatter looks like this...

```text
#+hugo_base_dir: ../
#+hugo_section: ./

#+hugo_weight: auto
#+hugo_auto_set_lastmod: t
#+hugo_front_matter_format: yaml
#+hugo_front_matter_key_replace: description>summary author>nil
#+category: blog
```

And then an individual post heading looks like this...

```text
DONE I forget how fun ox-hugo is :@Meta:hugo:orgmode:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: i-forget-how-fun-ox-hugo-is
:EXPORT_DATE: <2021-05-25 Tue>
:ID:       3942bdfb-50c1-41d1-be0b-eec21b615047
:END:
```

Here's the (ya)snippet:

```org
# -*- mode: snippet -*-
# name: Hugo
# key: hugo
# uuid: hugo
# --
TODO ${1:title}
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: ${1:$(replace-regexp-in-string " " "-" (downcase yas-text))}
:EXPORT_DATE:
:END:

$0
```

And here's what the org document looks like in Emacs.

{{< figure src="posts.png" >}}

There's a whole blog in there!
