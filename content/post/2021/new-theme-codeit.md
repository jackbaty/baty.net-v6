The theme I was using here had an annoying behavior, so I got a new one.

<!--more-->

My original theme, based on Even, did this thing where the content would jump just a little whenever the page loaded. It was driving me nuts, and I couldn't figure out what was causing it, so I punted and forked [CodeIT](https://github.com/sunt-programator/CodeIT).

You may recognize CodeIT because it was what I used before [archiving baty.net](https://archive.baty.net) a few months ago.

**UPDATE 2021-06-09**: Nope. I like Even better and am willing to take the hit on the "jumping" behavior if I'm unable to figure out what's causing it.
