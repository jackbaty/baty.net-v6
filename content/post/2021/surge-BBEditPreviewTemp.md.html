<p>I tried <a href="https://surge.sh">Surge.sh</a> and it’s pretty slick.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Static web publishing for Front-End Developers</p>
<p>Simple, single-command web publishing. Publish HTML, CSS, and JS for free, without leaving the command line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s great that there’s a generous free tier, but it comes with a couple limitations.</p>
<ul>
<li>The free tier does not support redirects</li>
<li>The free tier does not automatically redirect http-&gt;https</li>
<li>Deployment is not based on diffs. The entire app is re-uploaded each time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried it with baty.net and was able to create my account and deploy the site to a .surge.sh subdomain in just a few lines in the terminal. That was neat. I may try it for smaller or infrequently-deployed static sites.</p>
