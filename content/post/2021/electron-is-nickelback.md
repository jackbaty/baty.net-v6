Things that matter to me in a password manager, in order of importance:

- Reliability and security
- Functionality
- Reputation
- Ease of use
- Multi-platform/portability
- ...
- 100% native app with perfect macOS integration

My family and I will be sticking with [[1Password]] Family plan even though it's now a subscription-only Electron app.

There are valid reasons to dislike Electrion apps, but I'm convinced that many people hate it simply because The Internet told them it's bad. Much like people who hate Nickleback but couldn't name a Nickleback song or those who make fun of Comic Sans but couldn't pick it out of a lineup.
