[Gabe, Macdrifter](http://www.macdrifter.com/2021/06/forced-social-engagement.html):

> Am I the only one that's noticed a rise in app developers pushing customers into mandated relationships through Discord and Slack as "support" channels? It feels like a trend and I am not onboard with this investment in other people's business. Sure, I love a good user forum, but Slack and Discord are garbage user forums.

Strong agree.
