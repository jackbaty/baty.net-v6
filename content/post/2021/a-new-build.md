I've been feeling like blogging with Hugo again, so here we are.

I'm running a stock version of the theme [Even](https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even) via Hugo module. The site is deployed to a Digital Ocean instance running the [Caddy web server](https://caddyserver.com).

Feels good, but I don't know what I'll do with it.

Oh, and the domain is "v6.baty.net". I figured that way I can change things up later without breaking URLs. I picked "v6" randomly, since we _must_ be on that version at least, right?
