Once in a while I find myself in a foul mood about software proliferation and my tendencies to extend and overcomplicate everything. Today, for example.

So, this week, I'm seeing how much I can manage using Emacs (with Org mode), the filesystem, a terminal, and a web browser. As you can imagine, it's impossible. I'm sure I've written about this before, but it's on my mind again so I'm updating the list while I'm here.

Below is a quick list of software (on my Macs) that I always have available and for which no reasonable substitutes exists (that aren't just more software).

-   [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
-   [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.net/)
-   Finder
-   [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/)

There, that should be it, right? Uh, nope...

-   [Signal](https://signal.org/en/)
-   [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)

And then there are the utilities and background apps...

-   [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/)
-   [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
-   [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com/)

-   [Camo Studio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/camo-webcam-for-mac-and-pc/id1514199064)
-   [CleanShot X](https://setapp.com/apps/cleanshot)

Some of these could be replaced with browser, Emacs, or command-line versions, but at a significant loss of utility. That list also only includes the must-have-and-can't-find-replacement apps. I have dozens more installed that I use occasionally but don't technically need.
The current exercise of using just a few is mostly a reminder to stop installing and configuring every app I see and maybe just get some stuff done instead.
