I'm sorry, Safari, but until you reconsider the completely and objectively[^fn:1] terrible changes made in version 15, I'll be using [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com). I never thought I'd end up back in a Chromium based browser, but Vivaldi is quite nice. It packs a lot of capabilities into a small space. This, as opposed to Safari 15, which ruined an already smaller set of capabilities in the unnecessary quest to take up less space.

[^fn:1]: You could argue about "objectively" but I'm sticking with it.
