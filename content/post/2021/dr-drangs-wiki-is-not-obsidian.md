[Scripts for my homemade wiki - All this](https://leancrew.com/all-this/2021/08/scripts-for-my-homemade-wiki/)

> The growing enthusiasm over Obsidian hasn’t changed my mind. If anything, it’s hardened me against it. The plethora of plugins and tweaks available for it have convinced me that if I were to use it for my wiki of hints, most of the hints would be about Obsidian itself. That’s not my goal. If you can use Obsidian without continually adjusting it, you have a stronger mind (and stomach) that I do. I’ll stick with plain ol’ HTML.

I'm not sure why, but I also have an inexplicable aversion to Obsidian. By most measures it's pretty great, really, but I don't like how it looks, feels, or works.
