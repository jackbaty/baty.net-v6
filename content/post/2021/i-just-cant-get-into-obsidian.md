I want to put all my long-term thinking into a nice, future-proof, private-first folder full of text files, I really do.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) should be ideal for this, but I just can't get into it. I've tried so many times.

-   `CTRL-n` and `CTRL-p` (Emacs) bindings don't work in lists (such as the switcher and command palettes) like they do in nearly every other app on my Mac
-   I don't like how it looks
-   I don't like how it _feels_ (it's no real Mac app, that's for sure)
-   The Daily Notes feature is not as smooth or useful

This is disappointing for me, because Obsidian otherwise ticks all the right boxes. Unfortunately, if I'm not feeling it, I won't be using it.
