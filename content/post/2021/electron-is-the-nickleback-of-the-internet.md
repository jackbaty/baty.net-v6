[1Password 8](https://1password.community/discussion/122136/) uses Electron and the internet is already collectively shitting its pants before many people have even tried it.

Things that matter to me in a password manager, in order of importance:

- Reliability and security
- Functionality
- Reputation
- Ease of use
- Multi-platform/portability
- ...
- 100% native app with perfect macOS integration

My family and I will be sticking with the 1Password plan, even though it's now a subscription-only Electron app.

There are valid reasons to dislike Electron apps, but most of them aren't meaningful to me in day-to-day use. 

I'm convinced that many people hate it simply because The Internet told them it's bad[^1]. Much like people who claim to hate Nickelback but couldn't name a Nickelback song or those who make fun of Comic Sans but couldn't pick it out of a lineup.

All things being equal, I'll always choose a native macOS app, but all things are almost never equal.
