Since [Goatcounter](https://www.goatcounter.com) is free for non-commercial use under 100,000 views per month, I thought I'd give it another try.

<!--more-->

I've been using [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) for a long time and have no issues. Still, Goatcounter is free and at least as privacy-minded and who am I not to at least try it?

UPDATE 2021-06-05: I still find Goatcounter too hard to parse, so I'm removing it.
